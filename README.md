========
<p>It's a working simulator of Rubik's cube like puzzle named <b>Megaminx</b>
Unfortunately, mouse controls still not realized.</p>
<h2>Controls:</h2>
<p>F1-12 - rotate sides, shift+F1-12 - rotate this side backwards<br />
backspace - scramble<br />
space - pause (just for testing render, cause there's no timer)</p>
